			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				First of all, I want to thank everyone for their support over the past two months.  After I announced ASIDE was shutting down the amount of gratitude and number of people offering to help was so much greater than I ever would've imagined.  I really appreciate everyone reaching out and voicing their opinion.<br/><br/>  
				
				Due to all your support, ASIDE is not shutting down on the originally planned date of June 1st, 2019!  However, we aren't out of the woods yet.<br/><br/>  
				
				Currently ASIDE is going through an open source review. If I cannot obtain approval then I will have to shutdown ASIDE immediately.  However, if I do obtain approval to open source ASIDE, then I plan to make ASIDE available two different ways.
				
				<ul>
				<li>
				The same way it always has been, available @ www.aside.io.  Many people have expressed their desire to host ASIDE to me.  I will start reaching out to people who are interested in hosting ASIDE as I get closer to the completion of the open source review process.  My goal is to hand the aside.io domain over to whoever seems like they will be able to most reliably host ASIDE for the entire developer community.
				</li>
				<li>
				Even if I cannot find a host (which I dont think will be the case), I plan to add a "Deploy to Heroku" button to the GitHub project that will contain ASIDE's source code.  The Deploy to Heroku button will enable users to spin up their own personal instance of ASIDE at the free Heroku tier (assuming there arent more than a few users using that instance).
				</li>
				</ul>
				I'll keep you all updated with whats next for ASIDE when I know whats next.<br/><br/>  
				
				Thanks for everything!
