			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				The ASIDE.IO website in it's current form is shutting down 6/19/2020 at 11:59 PM CST.<br /><br />
				However, that doesn't mean ASIDE is going away.  ASIDE is now open source, and 
				<a href="https://github.com/fillip/aside-io" class="text-link" target="_blank">you can view it's code here</a>.  
				Additionally, it's now very easy to setup 
				your own instance of ASIDE.  <a href="/new_instance" class="text-link" target="_blank">Follow the steps here</a> 
				to create your personal instance 
				of ASIDE that you can host for free and keep up as long as you want.  
				<br /><br />
				Beyond 6/19/2020 you will not be able to visit <span class="term">www.aside.io</span> to use ASIDE.  
				You will need to create your own instance of ASIDE using the steps at the link above if you want to continue using ASIDE.  
				After that date it will redirect to ASIDE's 
				GitHub repository.  This is because I will no longer be able to host the ASIDE.IO website.
				<br/><br/>
				However, just because I can no longer 
				host the website doesn't mean that you can't.  If you see the value in this tool and are seriously interested in hosting 
				ASIDE for the developer community, please contact me at 
				<a class="text-link" href="mailto:admin@aside.io" target="_blank">admin@aside.io</a> 
				and I can potentially hand the ASIDE.IO domain over to you to keep the website alive.  
				<br /><br />
				Thanks for your support and my apologies for the short notice.<br/>
