			<div class="mt4 text-block">
ASIDE.IO is <span class="important">A</span> <span class="important">S</span>alesforce <span class="important">IDE</span> that is fast, free, and always available.  It is full-featured and supports the entire Salesforce development cycle from writing code, to running unit tests, querying/managing data, and deploying the resulting application.  
<br /><br />
There is no download required to start using ASIDE.IO, it lives in the cloud and is happy to be up there.  Having Salesforce development tools in the cloud is a natural extension of the code and compiler being stored there.  Eliminating a dependency on local workspaces of code already stored in the cloud reduces save conflicts and lost code because you are working against the source and not a copy of it. 
<br /><br />
ASIDE.IO is not the product of a company; it has been designed, developed, and maintained solely by me, Phil Rymek (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/philrymek" class="text-link">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-rymek-a8517398/" class="text-link">LinkedIn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fillip" class="text-link">GitHub</a>), as my hobby project over the course of many years.  <span class="important">I sincerely hope you like it and thank you for using it.</span>

			<div class="mt4 text-block">
Created in early 2012, ASIDE.IO started off as a simple experiment.  I wanted to know if you could execute Apex code from Apex code, similar to JavaScript’s <span class="term">eval</span> function.  After a bit of research I found out it was possible by calling Force.com APIs to execute anonymous from Apex code.
<br /><br />
From here the next logical step for me was to throw a UI on top of my shiny new Apex <span class="term">eval</span> function.  It didn’t take long for me to find the amazing <a class="text-link" href="https://ace.c9.io" target="_blank">ACE Editor</a> and hook it up to the code I had written.  While crude, the result was exciting, and invigorated me to see what else I could create.  From here d3v (pronounced “dev”, as in “developer”) was born, a Visualforce page that had some basic functionality to aid me in my daily tasks.
<br /><br />
As d3v gained more functionality, I had a blast using and building it, but wanted to open it up to a larger audience.  At this point Salesforce had acquired Heroku so it seemed like the logical place for me to host d3v.  From here there was a long transition process as I ported d3v over to Heroku, translated an Apex backend into Ruby, and opened d3v up to the public.
<br /><br />
Even as d3v became more capable, there weren’t many people using it.  At that point it performed well, but was ugly and had a stupid name.  In an attempt to get more users and right these wrongs, many changes were made: d3v was given a new interface, many bugs were fixed, and it was relaunched as ASIDE.IO in February 2014.
<br /><br />
The rebranding was successful – on day 1 more people used ASIDE.IO than had ever used d3v.   Over time ASIDE.IO has continued to gain more popularity and functionality, and turned into the full-featured Salesforce development tool that it is today.
