			<h2 id="current" class="mt4 title-item">Hosting Your Own Instance of ASIDE</h2>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				It's now possible to spin up your own instance of ASIDE in just a few steps. Follow the guide below 
				to deploy a new version of the app and then configure the OAuth login.
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="mt4 title-item">Prerequisites</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				Before you can setup a new instance of ASIDE you're going to need a couple things:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						A Heroku account
						<ul>
							<li>
								Sign up is free at: <a href="https://www.heroku.com" class="text-link" target="_blank">https://www.heroku.com</a>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						A Salesforce org that you are a system administrator in
						<ul>
							<li>
								This org will be used to contain the <span class="important">Connected App</span> that 
								facilitates the OAuth login ASIDE uses. 
								This should probably be a <span class="term">developer edition</span> or 
								<span class="term">production organization</span>, but any org will work. 
								It's not necessarily the same org that you plan on logging into ASIDE with.  
								It can be, but it does not need to be.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="mt4 title-item">Deploy the Heroku Application</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				Click the button below to begin the deployment process for ASIDE.  It will open a new page 
				which contains a form with a couple fields relating to the deployment.
				<br/>
				<a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffillip%2Faside-io" target="_blank">
					<img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png" class="mt3" />
				</a>
				<br/><br/>
				Fill out the <span class="term">App name</span> field. The <span class="term">App name</span> will dictate 
				what the URL is to access the application.  For example, if the <span class="term">App name</span> is 
				<span class="important">"my-aside"</span> then the URL is <span class="important">"https://my-aside.herokuapp.com"</span>.  
				Click the <span class="term">Deploy app</span> button.
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="mt4 title-item">Create the Connected App</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				From within Salesforce (and in the Lightning Experience UI), go to the setup menu.  Type <span class="term">App Manager</span> 
				in the <span class="important">Quick Find</span> search, and click the <span class="term">App Manager</span> setup item.  
				In the top right of the screen, you should see a button, <span class="important">New Connected App</span>.  Click the button to 
				begin creating the <span class="important">Connected App</span>.
				<br /><br />
				From the <span class="important">New Connected App</span> screen, populate the first three required fields 
				(<span class="term">Connected App Name</span>, <span class="term">API Name</span>, <span class="term">Contact Email)</span>; their 
				values are not important.  Scroll down to the <span class="important">"API (Enable OAuth Settings)"</span> section and check the 
				<span class="term">Enable OAuth Settings</span> checkbox.  A handful of additional fields should now be displaying in this section.
				<br /><br />
				Populate the required field <span class="term">Callback URL</span> with the URL to the instance of ASIDE you 
				just deployed with <span class="important">"/auth"</span> added to the end.  For example, if your new instance of 
				ASIDE is available at <span class="important">"https://my-aside.herokuapp.com"</span> then the 
				<span class="term">Callback URL</span> is <span class="important">"https://my-aside.herokuapp.com/auth"</span>.
				<br /><br />
				The last field you have to fill out to finish configuring the <span class="important">Connected App</span> is the 
				<span class="term">Selected OAuth Scopes</span> field.  Choose a value of <span class="important">"Full access (full)"</span> 
				and click the save button to finish configuring the <span class="important">Connected App</span>.
				<br /><br />
				Now that you have created a <span class="important">Connected App</span> it has two fields which are populated by Salesforce 
				on it's detail page: <span class="term">Consumer Key</span> and <span class="term">Consumer Secret</span>.  
				Their values will be used to finish configuring the application in the next step.
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="mt4 title-item">Add the Heroku Config Vars</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				As a final step, you will need to populate the <span class="term">Config Vars</span> within Heroku in order for ASIDE's OAuth based 
				login to work.  When logged into Heroku and viewing the application dashboard for the Heroku app you deployed earlier, 
				click the <span class="important">Settings</span> tab.  Within the <span class="term">Config Vars</span> section click 
				<span class="important">Reveal Config Vars</span>.  Add the three new <span class="term">Config Vars</span> detailed below.
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="term">CID</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								This is the <span class="term">Consumer Key</span> from the 
								<span class="important">Connected App</span> you created in Salesforce.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="term">SEC</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								This is the <span class="term">Consumer Secret</span> from the 
								<span class="important">Connected App</span> you created in Salesforce.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="term">URL</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								This is the URL where the version of ASIDE is hosted at.  The <span class="term">App name</span> 
								defined earlier will dictate what the URL is to access the application.  For example, if the 
								<span class="term">App name</span> is <span class="important">"my-aside"</span> then the 
								URL is <span class="important">"https://my-aside.herokuapp.com"</span>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				After adding these three <span class="term">Config Vars</span> you should be able to login to your new instance of ASIDE.
			</div>
			
			<h2 class="mt4 title-item">All Done!</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				You have now deployed your own copy of ASIDE and configured OAuth to work.  Your copy of ASIDE should be fully operational at 
				this point.  If you still can't login, wait 10 minutes.  The <span class="important">Connected App</span> can sometimes take a bit to be available for use.
				<span class="bold">Thanks for using ASIDE!</span>
			</div>
			
			<h3 class="mt4 title-item">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<div class="mt4 text-block">
				Below are some questions that might be on your mind after reading through this guide:
				<br />
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">Why can't I login?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					It takes a while for for the <span class="important">Connected App</span> to be available for use sometimes.  Wait 10 minutes and try again.  
					If that doesn't work, double check your configuration.  If that doesn't work, read the 
					<a href="/help" class="text-link" target="_blank">help</a> for more info on login failures.
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">Is this really free?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					It's free as described in this guide.  By default the application will be configured to use the Heroku free tier.  
					To obtain more performance to host more users you may need to leave the free tier.
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">How do I setup SSL?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					You can read more info about that 
					<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl" target="_blank" class="text-link">here</a>. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">How do I setup a custom domain?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					Heroku has a knowledge article about this topic 
					<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains" target="_blank" class="text-link">here</a>.  
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">
						Will my version of the application automatically update when the associated git repository is updated?
					</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					Not by default.  However, you can configure the app in Heroku (from the <span class="term">Settings</span> tab 
					in the Heroku application dashboard) to be directly connected to ASIDE's git repository and then 
					enable automatic deploys to accomplish this.
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">Can you tell me more about how the login for ASIDE works?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					It uses the OAuth web server flow.  Salesforce has documentation on it 
					<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_understanding_web_server_oauth_flow.htm" target="_blank" class="text-link">here</a>.  
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">Does the Connected App really need an OAuth Scope of Full?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					Probably not, but it's safest to leave it at that setting.  The definition of full access changes over time as 
					Salesforce obtains new capabilities and permissions to go along with those capabilities.  When ASIDE was originally created it
					needed full access but it probably does not need that much access now (e.g. looking at the scope list, it probably 
					does not need access to wave and eclair data).
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">Is there an easy way to hook up ASIDE to google analytics?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					Indeed there is!  Within the heroku config vars setup add a fourth key, its name should be 
					<span class="term">GID</span> and its value should be your google analytics tracking id.
				</div>
				
				<div class="mt4">
					<span class="italic bold">How does the posi-trac rear end on a Plymouth work?</span>
				</div>
				<div class="mt2">
					It just does.
